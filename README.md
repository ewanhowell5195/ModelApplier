# ModelApplier
ModelApplier is a datapack that allows you to to easily change the displayed model of items in survival mode.

## How to use
1. Rename any item using an anvil to have the name of the model you want. For example: rename a stick to `diamond_sword`. The renamed name must be the item ID if the item you want to use, not it's item name, so `Diamond Sword` will not work.
   - Custom namespaced items can be used too, for example naming the item `custom:my_custom_item`
2. Use ModelApplier to apply the model. Hold the item in your main hand, then:
   - Pause the game, press the `ModelApplier` option, then select `Apply Model`
   - OR: Press G to open the quick actions menu, then select `Apply Model`
   - OR: Use the command `/trigger applymodel`
3. Your model will now be applied. You can rename the item again if you want it to have a unique name.

## Bonus Feature
Once a model has been applied to an item, that item will be able to be worn on the head, even if it didn't support that originally.
